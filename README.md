Bookeida is a simple and lightweight book management web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add their favorite books with title, author, and description â€” and delete them when needed. This project helped me grasp key JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic element creation.
